For the user to begin, click 'Get Started' on the home page. Once directed to the notes page, the user may enter a note title in the 'Note Title' text area. Underneath the note title, the user will need to enter the text of the note. Once a note has a title and text filled out, a 'Save Note' button will appear, and the user may save the note. It will then appear on the left side of the page as a list. When the user adds more notes, they will be displayed with the other saved notes. If the user wishes to delete a note, they will need to click on the delete icon next to the corresponding note they wish to delete. All notes will be persistently stored.
